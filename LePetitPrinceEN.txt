TO LEON WERTH\nI ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. \nI have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. \nI have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. \nI have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. \nHe needs cheering up. \nIf all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. \nAll grown-ups were once children\n(although few of them remember it.)\nAnd so I correct my dedication:\nTO LEON WERTH\nWHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY
